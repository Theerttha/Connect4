How to Play
Player and computer take turns dropping one piece into a column of their choice.
The piece falls to the lowest available row in that column.
The game continues until a player connects four pieces in a row or the board is full.

Winning the Game
A player wins if they align four of their pieces in a row:
Horizontally
Vertically
Diagonally
If the board fills up and no player has four in a row, the game ends in a draw.

Rules to Keep in Mind
✔️ You must place a piece in a non-full column.
✔️ You cannot remove or move a piece once it’s placed.
✔️ The game ends as soon as a player wins or the board is full.
